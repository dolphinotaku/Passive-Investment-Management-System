## Abstract
I want to earn more money then I go to invest. I was using excel at the very beinging, it was well after I made it becomes intelligent. But a excel cannot satisfy my family, so I try to find a open source to help me. After that I give up when I cannot found any avaiable open sources. In conclusion, we belives that the company/organization would purchase one because they can afford, the demends of similar open source softwares decreased. Finally, we try to make one for free, fun and interest.
